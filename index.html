    <h1>Dylan Vo</h1>
    <p>I am a motivated second year undergraduate Data Science student, expecting to graduate in June 2026. I have strong foundational skills in Data Processing and Analysis, Machine Learning, and AI, with experience in large databases. I am interested and excited to apply my skills  with real-world data to reach solutions and solve problems. I am currently actively open to and seeking any Data Science related internships and summer jobs.</p>
